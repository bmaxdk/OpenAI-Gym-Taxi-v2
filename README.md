### The workspace contains three files:
#### agent.py: Develop your reinforcement learning agent here. This is the only file that you should modify.
#### monitor.py: The interact function tests how well your agent learns from interaction with the environment.
#### main.py: Run this file in the terminal to check the performance of your agent.
